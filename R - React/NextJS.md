-   **Static Generation (Recommended):** The HTML is generated at **build time** and will be reused on each request. To make a page use Static Generation, either export the page component, or export `getStaticProps` (and `getStaticPaths` if necessary). It's great for pages that can be pre-rendered ahead of a user's request. You can also use it with Client-side Rendering to bring in additional data.
-   **Server-side Rendering:** The HTML is generated on **each request**. To make a page use Server-side Rendering, export `getServerSideProps`. Because Server-side Rendering results in slower performance than Static Generation, use this only if absolutely necessary.
