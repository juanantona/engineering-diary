- “Some habits of ineffectiveness are rooted in our social conditioning toward quick-fix, short-term thinking.”

- Promotions, at their worst, are nothing. A nominal title change with virtually no change to anything else. At their most normal, promotions represent a rare, formal recognition of a job well done that includes pay and title increase. They feel good for about a week, but those feelings are ephemeral. Generally, it’s back to business as usual, the promotion offering no clarity on what the future holds, what it should hold, and how to get there.
- If we focus on our careers at all we will often do so with no real intentionality, with no grounding in anything logical, and without a shred of analytical thinking. These plans are almost never grounded in a compelling future, are almost never grounded in a shared sense of one’s past, and therefore it’s nearly impossible to arrive at any sort of relevant conclusion about what someone should do right now in service to their career aspirations.

We’ve got to start doing Career Conversations with a more structured, intentional approach. **We have to understand the past and the future in order to know what to do in the present, what to do right now.**

##### Start with the Past – Life Story
- The first step is to understand people’s motivations and values, the things that drive them. It’s amazing what you can learn from a person’s life story if you pay close attention to and ask about their major pivots and transitions. Why did they make them? What did those transitions teach them about what they love and hate about their work?

##### Talk about the Future – Dreams
- Step two is understanding where people want to be at the pinnacle of their careers. Some are skeptical that our younger workers know what they want to be when they grow up. Everyone has dreams, though, and we just have to help people make them a little more tangible.

##### Plan for the Present – Career Action Plan
- With an understanding of the past and the future, we’re only now able to build a relevant and thoughtful action plan with clear owners and clear timelines. We can see the path behind us, we can see the lighthouse in the distance, and now we just need to start laying some flagstones on the ground to connect the two.

“A lot of times when we think about career, we’re a broken record, stuck on: what’s next, what’s next, what’s next. People are hungry to know what their next job will be, or when that next promotion is coming,”

“If people feel like they’ve got a manager who’s got their back and investing them in a differentiated way, it’s a different result. If we’re being explicit about doing some things in their current role that can take them toward the end goal in their career, that helps reduce the ants in their pants a little bit. People tend to want to stay put.”
